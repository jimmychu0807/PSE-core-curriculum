# Module 8 - Open Source Contribution

Welcome to Module 8! In the next three weeks, we will be asking you to contribute to open source projects in the ZK space. To get started, let's first take a look at what it means to contribute to open source.

## What is Open Source?

Before you jump in, let's get clear on what open source means. Wikipedia defines Open Source software as the following:

> Open source is source code that is made freely available for possible modification and redistribution.

At its core, it's a community of people around the world that wants to write code, not for money, but because we believe that something should exist in the world and we want to share it with everyone!

But beyond that, open source work can have a lot of benefits for career and professional growth as well.

As the first step in this stage, please watch the following video.

## Get Your Hands Dirty

### Curriculum Feedback

First, let's get you comfortable with the open-source workflow. We've set up a curriculum repo for you to practice. Your feedback not only helps us but also lets you get the hang of things like pull requests.

1. Head to the [Summer Contribution Program Curriculum repo](https://github.com/adrianmcli/summer-contribution-program).
2. Drop your feedback under the Issues tabâ€”bugs, comments, whatever.
3. Create a pull request to implement your suggestions.

### PSE Good First Issue Tracker

Next, we've got a special issue tracker focused on PSE projects. This is another sandbox for you to practice open-source contributions while also helping us improve this tool. This can be your first code-related open source contribution!

1. Visit [PSE Good First Issue tracker](https://pse-gfis.vercel.app/).
2. Since it's open source, feel free to submit Issues and PRs [here](https://github.com/adrianmcli/pse-gfis).

### Choose Your PSE Project

Finally, it's game time. Pick a project that resonates with you and dive in. This is where you apply what you've practiced and make a tangible impact.

1. Browse the [good first issue tracker](https://pse-gfis.vercel.app/).
2. Pick an issue and comment to let the maintainer know you're tackling it.

ðŸ“£ Beyond this point, you'll largely be on your own. But if you get stuck or have questions, just shoot us a message on Discord!
